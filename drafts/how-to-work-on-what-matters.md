# How to transition to working on what matters

A fieldguide is one way to view the landscape of a given area, it is an adventurer’s best friend for charting the unknown. Being able to work on what matters can be considered in a similar format, with an easy to follow recipe for how others can cook it in their own laboratories and a person guide to take and remix into their futures.

The goals of this fieldguide:

- To provide an actionable strategy for how to sustainably work on what matters to you,
- To be applicable to most situations and occupations, as a middle ground between working purely for money and purely for passion,
- To be a transition path from where you are to where you want to be.

The intended audience for this fieldguide:

- People already doing paid consulting work but struggle to find energy for their passion.
- People already pursuing passion, but struggling to fund their livelihood.
- People who are confused about the vision of Enspiral Services.

Here is a summary of the key points of this fieldguide:

1. Find what matters to you,
1. Understand your economic needs for livelihood,
1. Sell yourself to provide for economic needs,
1. Spend the rest of you on what matters,
1. Transform what matters into livelihood.

As with any fieldguide, this fieldguide is my personal perspective of the landscape, yet I hope it may be valuable for some other adventurers seeking another viewpoint of the same.

## Find what matters to you

What do you want to do with your life?

Here’s a few supplementary questions that have helped clarify this to me:

- What world do I want to live in?
- What work gives me energy? What work depletes my energy?
- How do I identify with the world?

Somewhere in the answers to these questions is what matters to you. Some examples of working with passion might be an ‘Omega Project’ (TODO link to a post by @dominictarr), a startup, mastery of a discipline, challenging a norm, creating beauty through art, etc. Even if it’s not what matters to my friend, the key here is to focus on YOU. Only through your authentic self is it possible to create positive impact for others.

## Understand your economic needs for livelihood

Before you can focus on problems larger than your immediate needs, you need to move beyond a life of scarcity/hand-to-mouth, consuming everything you earn. That means not having to worry about your next meal, where you will sleep, how you will communicate with friends, etc. In other words, a requirement for social change is personal livelihood, or abundance.

The goal is to create a financial gap that gives you freedom to focus on your passion.

I find it useful to frame this as satisfying your basic economic needs for livelihood within the current system, in other words how to supply our basic human rights:

- Food
- Water
- Shelter
- Electricity
- Internet
- Etc

Currently the dominant modus operandi for finding the financial resources to fund passionate work is through grant funding but that is difficult, tenuous and is goal driven as the needs of the grant must be met continuously. Is there an alternative?

## Sell yourself to provide for economic needs

As a first step I propose we fund passionate work through **part-time high-paid skilled work** to satisfy our basic economic needs for livelihood. Once you are in abundance, then you have a capacity to focus on what matters to you..

If you pursue economic abundance above your needs for livelihood than you will not have anything left to put into what matters to you.

In this situation, you can spend as much time as required consulting to achieve livelihood, the rest of your time is for  following your passion. Further, if you increase your ability to earn, or decrease your living expenses, you have more time to spend on your passion.

## Spend the rest of you on what matters

Now that you have some freedom, spend it on what you want to be doing!

## Transform what matters into livelihood

To me, the problem with what’s been described so far is that it requires I am still selling a part of myself to someone else for something that isn’t me.

No matter how hard I try to be a part-time drone and part-time mad scientist, traditional projects for clients always suck energy out of me so I’m left in a debt when I want to work on my passion. For my own projects, I have a preference for using [Simplicity-Oriented Design] and throwing away abandoned solutions when new solutions emerge in my intuitive mind. But when there are stakeholders and project managers, I struggle to work in a way that doesn’t leave me feeling empty and unproductive.

The above strategy comes from a compromise between working full-time on someone else’s project or starving full-time on my own projects. My real desire is to work full-time on my own projects, while still satisfying my basic economic for livelihood.

I haven’t yet found the secret recipe to cook this into reality, but I have tasted some ingredients within Enspiral. Enspiral’s consulting company, Enspiral Services, shares this vision (albeit is forgotten over time) of achieving livelihood through work that matters.

> “The original vision was that Services would be made up of teams that provided industry services such as design and development to internal and external clients. What actually happened was the creation of mini-ventures that collected together to share resources and support.
Enspiral Services is more of a melting pot, a science laboratory of projects, ventures and startups that don’t have enough muscle to go out on their own just now and are relying on their shared network to provide them with strength and stability while the grow or fail.” - Tracey Ambrose

Enspiral Services is a "primordial ooze" whereby we can collaborate with others towards our passions and create "proto-ventures" under our shared legal umbrella.
