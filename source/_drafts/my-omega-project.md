_TODO: link to @dominictarr on "What is an Omega Project" once he publishes something_

_TODO add: an Omega Project is like a personal narrative_

_TODO add: personal experiences that made me feel as part of a larger body of humans (the core narrative of my Omega Project), e.g. Occupy, Cloyne_

My Omega Project is to design, develop, and deploy simple, modular, and decentralized technical infrastructure for fractal socio-economic systems.

## graveyard of the past

for those who haven't noticed, [the list of my GitHub repos](https://github.com/ahdinosaur?tab=repositories) is somewhat of my personal project graveyard. here's some that embody my Omega Project:

- [unbazaar](http://dinosaur.is/unbazaar/docs/): an unhosted marketplace for local production
- [holonomy](http://holonomy.is/): the hive mind economy

i also worked on [Cobudget](http://cobudget.co) for a while, until i realized the short-term direction of the project wasn't helping me make progress towards my Omega Project.

## current mad science

- [Value Flows](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/): linked open data vocabularies for socio-economic systems of fractal networks
- [Holodex](https://github.com/open-app/holodex): an app for people, groups, and the relationships in-between

## next-up plan

my current plan of action is to develop and deploy modular apps based on our Value Flows's simple socio-economic vocabularies. Holodex is the first deliverable along this path, which aims to support Enspiral's [Open OS](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/os/content/en/index.html) as well as any other organizing systems that people design.

## vision of the future

_TODO add: we are all one consciousness. e.g. global human society as a single bee hive. what would an outside observer think of our society?_
