> ## Release Early, Release Often
>
> Linus was treating his users as co-developers in the most effective possible way:
>
> > _7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.

>  Linus was keeping his hacker/users constantly stimulated and rewardedâ€”stimulated by the prospect of having an ego-satisfying piece of the action, rewarded by the sight of constant (even daily) improvement in their work.

> Linus was directly aiming to maximize the number of person-hours thrown at debugging and development, even at the possible cost of instability in the code and user-base burnout if any serious bug proved intractable. Linus was behaving as though he believed something like this:

> > _8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.

> Or, less formally, "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.'' I dub this: `Linus's Law`.

### [OPEN open source](http://openopensource.org)

> ## What?

> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

### [(C4) Collective Code Construction Contract](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22)

> ## Goals

> C4 is meant to provide a reusable optimal collaboration model for open source software projects. It has these specific goals:

> - To maximize the scale of the community around a project, by reducing the friction for new Contributors and creating a scaled participation model with strong positive feedbacks;
> - To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any required domain;
> - To allow the project to develop faster and more accurately, by increasing the diversity of the decision making process;
> - To support the natural life cycle of project versions from experimental through to stable, by allowing safe experimentation, rapid failure, and isolation of stable code;
> - To reduce the internal complexity of project repositories, thus making it easier for Contributors to participate and reducing the scope for error;
> -To enforce collective ownership of the project, which increases economic incentive to Contributors and reduces the risk of hijack by hostile entities.
