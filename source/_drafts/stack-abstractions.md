what is an abstraction? what are stacks?

imagine the example of the car. we press a pedal with our foot, the car accelerates. we press a different pedal with our foot, the car decelerates. the car is a black box that we interface with through a pedal and our foot. our foot interfaces with the pedal, the pedal interfaces with some bits and bobs hidden from us that change the speed of the car. what is understood to be the function of speed control in a car is the combined functions of a pedal, our foot, and some bits and bobs.
