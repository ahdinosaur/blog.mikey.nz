> Enspiral started as a small group of contracting computer programmers who wanted to organise their working life to put more time and energy into making a positive social impact.

> “The main idea was to help people who want to change the world have the time and money to do so. So fundamentally, it’s about more people working on stuff that matters.” - Joshua Vial

first step is supporting your livelihood. you need to eat, sleep, drink, communicate, and be well. only when your livelihood is supported can you begin to creatively solve problems and follow your passion.

authors note: for me, i support my livelihood through contracting part-time 20 hours a week. then i have space to work on [my omega project]().

once you have a stable base, you can begin your journey of work.
quadrant of ownership and social impact of work: zero ownership, zero social impact, to ownership and social impact.

eventually replace contracting with products that fulfill your social / passion work.

products act as viruses to spread your message.
