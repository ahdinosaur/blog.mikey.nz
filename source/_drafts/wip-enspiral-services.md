**i see Enspiral Services as an economic organizing system for social good.**

## why Enspiral Services?

before you can focus on problems larger than your self, you need to not be in scarcity: worrying about your next meal, where you will sleep, how you will communicate with friends, etc. in other words, a requirement for social change is personal livelihood, or abundance.

to earn a livelihood, it's possible to do high-value consulting. once you are in abundance, then you have a capacity to focus on social change.

in this situation, you can spend X time consulting to achieve livelihood, then the rest of your time to follow your passion. further, if you increase your ability to earn value, or decrease your cost of life, you have more time to spend on your passion.

> note: the "cyber hobo" lifestyle is a particular technique where you aim to reduce the cost of life to a minimum, so you have much more capacity to focus elsewhere.

Enspiral Services is a community of pods living in this way. each pod focus on the livelihood of it's members, providing ways to increase value, reduce costs, and allow stability of life.

however this is only the beginning. more, the work we do towards our passion can become a source of earning, reducing our need to do other socially-netural work.

Enspiral Services is a "primordial ooze" whereby we can collaborate with others towards our passions and create "proto-ventures" under our shared legal umbrella.

eventually, the dream is to create livelihood through following our passion.
