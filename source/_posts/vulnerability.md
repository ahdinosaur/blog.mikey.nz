i connected with my roommate Daniel, here's what i discovered...

## the path

vulnerability -> acceptance -> fulfillment

not being compared, measured (salaries, net worth, location, etc)

## you're invited!

for example, Daniel noticed that my Tinder profile invites vulnerability.

by clearly showing up-front that i don't care about social norms, it's easy to be yourself!

## invulnerability

- symptoms
  - hard-lines
  - suppression
  - escapism
- causes
  - power feedback loop
    - external validation
    - authority

superheros are invulnerable, they cannot be touched by anything

[wonder woman]

## spoofing

some people spoof vulnerability while being invulnerable.

you play the game right, generate the right responses, but never open up to vulnerability.

vulnerability is characterized by fear, if you aren't afraid of anything, you aren't being vulnerable.
