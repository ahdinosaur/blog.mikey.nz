subtitle:

scalable coordination without money and transactions

description:

ever dream about a solarpunk future where society, nature, and technology support each other in harmony? dinosaur will first share some distinctions when viewing alternative futures, for example: objective vs subjective, sky-facing vs earth-facing, transactions vs relationships, capital vs resources, extrinsic motivations vs intrinsic motivations, engagement vs fulfillment; next use these lenses on existing systems, for example: hitch-hiking vs uber, couch surfing vs airbnb, hackerspaces vs makerspaces, open source vs closed source, and so on; then propose ideas for how to scale solarpunk coordination systems using technology; last open a discussion to participate in the patterns.

recently, i've been having conversations with my friend [Dominic Tarr](http://dominictarr.com/) about new territory we're exploring, what we roughly describe as "solarpunk economics".

the intention is to clarify some useful disctions, to determine whether a given system is more or less solarpunk.

i've already discovered the power of clear and refined language from the book ["Reinventing Organizations"](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/), so i'd like to share what we've uncovered so far.

## what is solarpunk economics?

in the most simple definition: solarpunk economics is to apply solarpunk values to economic practices.

by solarpunk, i mean [the harmony of society, nature, and technology](https://medium.com/solarpunks/solarpunk-a-reference-guide-8bcf18871965).

by economics, i mean [the management of our home](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/economics).

to explore our definition further, we will [sense from opposing sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic).

## opposing sides

these sides are not black and white, but rather shape a spectrum we can use as a lense to evaluate trade-offs.

the latter side is the current default that dominates our current system. in this way, the former side is usually preferable, however in these shades of grey we can expect exceptions, likely the best approach is a harmonic synthesis of all sides.

### subjective vs objective

subjectivity is when you give meaning to the world around you.

objectivity is when there is only one source of meaning, whether that be through God, science, markets, popular culture, or some other higher-power.

the most useful middle-ground is _shared subjectivity_ (also known as inter-subjectivity), where you acknowledge the convergent meaning across many sources.

### earth-facing vs sky-facing

(credit: [@arcalinea](https://twitter.com/arcalinea))

someone is earth-facing when their hopeful future is about being in communion with the ground.

someone is sky-facing when their hopeful future is about exploring space and virtual worlds.

### abundance vs scarcity

abundance is when you have enough, better known as sufficiency. abundance can often be mistaken for excess.

scarcity is when you don't have enough.

in many cases, especially amongst those with existing privilege, whether someone feels in abundance or scarcity is actually a matter of mindset, not material requirements.

### relationships vs transactions

an interaction is transactional when it is a strictly defined reciprocal process. for example, i give you this in exchange for that. often a transaction will involve money, but not always, for example a situation where i invited you to dinner at my place so now you are expected to invite me to dinner at your place.

see also my previous self's thoughts on this: [%mCvnOtBPY5t73V33rzBf2yZkFtS2KrvHoNHUIyymTCM=.sha256](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25mCvnOtBPY5t73V33rzBf2yZkFtS2KrvHoNHUIyymTCM%3D.sha256)

### resources vs capital

resources are tangible goods or services that produce value.

capital is a virtual token that may be exchnged for resources.

### intrinsic vs extrinsic

intrinsic motivation means you something is worth doing simply for its own sake.

extrisinc motivation means you are only doing something because something or something outside makes it worth doing.

### trust vs trustless

> don't trust. verify.

### revokable vs permanent

### voluntary vs involuntary

### fulfillment vs engagement

### agency vs individualism

agency is fractal at every level of our "self", not only the individual but also at every level of our collective organizations: the family, the village, the region, the world, the universe.

### generative vs extractive

## what are some examples?

### hitch-hiking vs uber

### couch-surfing vs airbnb

### potluck vs food delivery

### hackerspace vs makerspace

### savings pools vs insurance

### mesh networks vs ISPs

### mentorship networks vs universities

### protocol vs platform

a protocol provides a level playing field for anyone to participate, as long as they follow the rules specified in the protocol. in this way, the space is self-policed by the affordances of the protocol.

a platform is a shared space to play, but is privately owned. you may be allowed to participate as you wish, but at the end of the day the power rests in your feudal lord, for example Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.

somewhere in the middle is the idea of a "platform cooperative", where the platform is cooperatively owned by the workers and users.

### open source vs closed source

### open knowledge vs closed knowledge

### open data vs closed data

### clotheswap vs online shopping

### parties vs concerts

### sports club / team / fan base

### work party (mahi) vs paid work

### chore wheel

taking turns with collective responsibility
