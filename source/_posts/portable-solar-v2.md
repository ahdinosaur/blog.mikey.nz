excerpt: A new portable solar setup, the "right way"
---

I made a new portable solar setup, with help from ["Mobile Solar Power - Made Easy" by William Errol Prowse IV](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/the-book.html).

(An evolution from [Portable Solar v1](http://localhost:4000/portable-solar-v1/) and other learnings.)

The goal is to do a solar electric setup the "right way":

- with a better solar charge controller
- with an inverter
- with best practice schematic for how to wire everything together
- with appropriate circuit breakers and fuses
- with appropriate thick wires
- and so on...
